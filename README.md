This code creates a simple typing practice application with login functionality, a lesson practice section, a timed test, and a landing page. Here's a breakdown of improvements and some suggestions for further enhancements:

**Improvements and Fixes:**

* **Consistent Navigation:**  The navigation bar now consistently links to the correct pages (1.html, 2.html, and 3.html) across all three pages.
* **Clearer Login Redirect:** The login form now redirects to the practice page (2.html) after a successful (simulated) login.
* **Level Selection and Text Loading:** The level selection buttons in 2.html now correctly load different text snippets for each difficulty level.
* **Start Button Behavior:** The "Start" button in 2.html now correctly initializes the typing test on the selected level instead of defaulting to beginner every time.  It also gets disabled once the test starts.
* **Next Button Functionality:** The "Next" button now correctly resets the practice text and relevant statistics. It starts hidden and appears after a level is chosen.
* **Timer Accuracy:** The timer in the timed test (3.html) is now more accurate and updates every second.
* **Dropdown Population:** The minutes and pages dropdowns in 3.html are dynamically populated.
* **Highlighting Toggle:** The highlighting toggle in 3.html now works correctly.
* **Result Display:** The result of the timed test is displayed after the test ends.
* **Consistent Styling:** Used Tailwind CSS for consistent styling across all pages.
* **Code Clarity:** Added comments and improved variable names for better readability.


**Further Enhancements:**

* **Backend Integration:**  Currently, the login is just a client-side simulation. Implement a real backend (e.g., using Node.js, Python/Flask/Django, etc.) with a database to store user accounts, typing scores, and progress.
* **User Authentication:**  Use secure authentication methods (e.g., JWT) for user login and registration.
* **Progress Tracking:**  Store user typing statistics (WPM, accuracy) over time and display progress charts.
* **More Levels/Texts:** Add more levels and a larger variety of practice texts.  Consider fetching texts from an external API.
* **Word Highlighting:** Instead of character-by-character highlighting, highlight whole words for better visual feedback during typing.
* **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling for network requests and other potential issues.
* **Accessibility:**  Improve accessibility for users with disabilities (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).
* **Mobile Responsiveness:**  Ensure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes.
